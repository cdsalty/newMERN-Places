What is the difference between <Link> and <NavLink>?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47338077/react-router-v4-navlink-vs-link-benefits/47338222#47338222
  - the ONLY difference is that NavLink is a special version of "Link" 
    that will add styling attributes to the rendered element when it matches the current URL
  - When you use <Link> there isn't any active class on selected element. In contrast, with <NavLink> 
    the selected element is highlighted because this element is added an active class.
  - The activeStyle properties mean when we click on the Link, it should be highlighted with different
    style so that we can differentiate which link is currently active.
      - <NavLink to="/" exact activeStyleÂ±{{color: 'red'}}>Home</NavLink>
